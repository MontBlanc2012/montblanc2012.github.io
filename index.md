## Mont Blanc's orbital mechanics notes

Here is a list of articles on orbital mechanics.  The primary purpose of these notes is to help organise my own thoughts on the subject - but they may also be of interest to others.

* [Ellipses and Hyperbolas](ellipses1.html) - Equations to calculate the semi-major axis, $a$, the orbital eccentricity, $e$, and the time-of-flight, $\Delta t$ of the Keplerian arc (or arcs) connecting two points $P_1$ and $P_2$ and  at the same distance, $R$, from a gravitating body with gravitational constant $\mu$ and separated by an angle $\theta$ when the orbital periapsis radius $r_p$ is also known.

### Calculation of the perturbed gravitational field 

Here is a list of posts placed on the [Orbiter Forum](https://www.orbiter-forum.com) relating to the calculation of a perturbed gravitational field
