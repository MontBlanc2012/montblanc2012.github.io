## Orbital mechanics notes

The following a simple template that we are going to use to make a link to another sheet by clicking the following:

* [Ellipses and Hyperbolas](index.html) - Equations to calculate the semi-major axis, $a$, the orbital eccentricity, $e$, and the time-of-flight, $\Delta t$ of the Keplerian arc (or arcs) connecting two points $P_1$ and $P_2$ and  at the same distance, $R$, from a gravitating body with gravitational constant $\mu$ and separated by an angle $\theta$ when the orbital periapsis radius $r_p$ is also known.
